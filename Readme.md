## About:

Project of the "Web Design Completo" course on Origamid platform, which I went from the basic foundamentals about design, colors, typography, UX/UI design and Adobe XD prototypes to the coding: HTML, CSS, JavaScript plugins, responsive design and a PHP-Based Mail Sender form. I also learnt the basics about SEO, Optimization (HTML & CSS Validation and Compression), Domain Register, Hosting services and Google Analytics.
