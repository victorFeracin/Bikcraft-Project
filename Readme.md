## About:

Project of the "Web Design Completo" course on Origamid platform, which I went from the basic foundamentals about design, colors, typography, UX/UI design and Adobe XD prototypes to the coding: HTML, CSS, JavaScript plugins, responsive design and a PHP-Based Mail Sender form. I also learned the basics about SEO, Optimization (HTML & CSS Validation and Compression), Domain Register, Hosting services and Google Analytics.

**Note**: The following link takes to the domain registered by the teacher and creator of the course (Andr√© Rafael), so there are some writing differences between my code and the website, plus the "Blog" page is not developed in this course, so it will be missing in my commits.
